## Overview
This project models and optimizes dopant diffusion in silicon wafers using **Fick’s second law** and numerical PDE solvers.  
The goal is to determine the **optimal diffusion time and temperature** for three dopants—**Boron, Phosphorus, and Arsenic**—while achieving the target junction depth.

## Key Features
- Simulated dopant diffusion profiles C(x,t) for B, P, and As  
- Implemented time–temperature sweeps using Python  
- Applied optimization algorithms to reduce total process time  
- Compared diffusion behavior of all three dopants  
- Achieved **25–30% reduction** in processing time while meeting required junction depths  

## Tools Used
- **Python / Jupyter Notebook**  
- PDE solvers for diffusion modeling  
- Optimization routines for time–temperature trade-off  
- Data visualization for concentration profiles and junction depth tracking  

## What the Code Produces
- Time vs. depth diffusion curves  
- Concentration distribution C(x,t)  
- Optimal time–temperature combinations for each dopant  
- Cross-dopant comparison charts  
- Process-time reduction metrics  

## Applications
- Semiconductor process design  
- Junction engineering  
- Thermal diffusion optimization  
- Academic and industrial R&D in microelectronics
